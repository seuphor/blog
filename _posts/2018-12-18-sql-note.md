## Tips
- As a best practice you should try to order your table join so the join that **reduces the result set the most** is joined first. 

## Tips with examples
- You can declare Constant and stores in constant table
```sql
-- declare the constant
WITH constant AS(
SELECT 
  600 AS numb1, 
  1800 AS numb2
)
-- get the constant
SELECT *
FROM constant
```

- In MySQL, you can emuerate row_number by following:
```sql
SET @row = 0;
SELECT @row:=@row+1
FROM datatable
-- You may also enumerate the ROW_NUMBER OVER PARTITION BY
SET @row_number = 0;
SET @customer_no = 0;
SELECT 
    @row_number:=CASE
        WHEN @customer_no = customerNumber THEN @row_number + 1
        ELSE 1
    END AS num,
    @customer_no:=customerNumber as CustomerNumber,
    paymentDate,
    amount
FROM
    payments
ORDER BY customerNumber;
```
